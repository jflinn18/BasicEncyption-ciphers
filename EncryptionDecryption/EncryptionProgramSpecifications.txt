Encryption Program Specifications:

This program takes any latin alphabet text document and tranforms the characters according an algorithm.
There are different ciphers that can be used.  The user will be given the choice to enter the cipher that
they would like to use.  Depending on the cipher, the user will also be given the option on how to use 
the cipher.  For exmaple, for a ceasar shift cipher, it will ask the user how many shifts they want to 
use.  

The program will have both an encryption and decryption option.  Both will ask the user for the cipher it
will use to manipulate the text.  And it will ask for any other information that it would need to 
decrypt the cipher text.  However, this information may be added into the text, like the first (or last) 
numbers if it was a numbered cipher text.  


Possible additions:
-Brute force decryption trying all of the ciphers in the database.
